# START2 manifesto
The START2 network is a form of knowledge and experience exchange based on a set of principles. These principles exist to mitigate common perceived problems in knowledge exchange where participants are from different competitors.

The START2 setup could be a complement to for example lean coffee or open space.

Examples of perceived problems with regular conferences:

* Vendor expectation management focus from commersial business agendas
* Broadcasting information rather than focus on discussion and true experience exchange
* The non-loud-mouths get little space for their thoughts and ideas

## Why START2?
Some 15 years ago a network of experienced QA professional was gathered under the name of START. The initiative was ongoing for a few years until it eventually died out. Recently a lack of forums like this has become apparent. Hence, this new manifesto is compiled.

## START2 manifesto
&nbsp;**1. Must-haves**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1. Meetings are to be held at neutral grounds like someones home, chambre séparée, summer house, or conference facility. START2 sessions are not a marketing event.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2. Each meeting should be centered around a specific theme to enable choosing relevant participants.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3. Each participant should bring a short presentation on the choosen theme. The presentation must be about an actual personal experience.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4. After each presentation plenty of time for discussions is planned since discussions are the center of gaining insights in experience exchanges.  

&nbsp;**2. Should-haves**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Any START2 event should have lot of time to mingle. If you bring a lot of people enthusiastic around the same subject or topic together and give them time they'll happily enter nerd-mode.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. The group size should never be larger than 10 people since bigger groups get problems with participants not participating.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. START2 event time should be enough for everyone to hold their presentation and everyone to have a lengthy in-depth discussion about the experience presented.  

&nbsp;**3. Could-haves**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. If some people stay silent/inactive in discussions due to other people being more extrovert or louder, a Internet-forum like comment system of diffently coulored postit notes or similar could be used:  
* _Green_ for new thread
* _Yellow_ for comment on current topic
* _Blue_ for reply to previous comment
Each participands has a set of these and if any of these cards are held up by a participant, the moderator make sure all people get their things said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2. Discussions could be timeboxed to a set time.
