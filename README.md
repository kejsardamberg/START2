# START2 manifesto
*The START2 network is a form of knowledge and experience exchange based on a set of principles. These principles exist to mitigate common perceived problems in knowledge exchange where participants are from different competitors.*  

The START2 setup could be a complement to for example _lean coffee_ or _open space_.

Examples of perceived problems with regular conferences:

* Vendor expectation management focus from commersial business agendas
* Sponsor pleasing from conference staff means sales or marketing presentations rather than true knowledge sharing
* Bleak presentations that has to be made with thoughts on the least knowledgeable person in the expected target audience
* Presenters boasting their experiences rather than open up displaying their fears, problems or weaknesses for support by others
* Information is broadcasted from the speaker rather than focus on discussion and true experience exchange
* The non-loud-mouths get little room for their thoughts and ideas in a big crowd
* Conferences attract people of various ambitions and not only people who want to develop their skills and insights. E.g.:
  * People who want to get away from work for a while
  * People who want to get entertained while resting the brain
  * People who want to know they are doing everything correct so they confirm they don't have to change
  * People who are pushed to the conference by management
  * Whole departments for HR checkbox reasons

## Why START2?
Back in the early 2010's a network of experienced QA professional was gathered under the name of _START_. The initiative was ongoing for a few years until it eventually died out. Recently a lack of forums like this has become apparent. Hence, this new manifesto is compiled in hope of a new era of knowledge sharing.

## Key concepts
The center of gaining insights isn't just knowledge, or even experiences. The center of gaining insights is discussing the experiences to gain understanding on why something works in a specific context and not in another.

Sharing with a focus on problemsolving rather than boasting.

To enable these discussions the manifesto below has been produced.

## START2 manifesto
&nbsp;**1. Must-haves**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1. Meetings are to be held at neutral grounds like someones home, chambre séparée, summer house, or conference facility. START2 sessions are not a marketing event.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2. Each meeting should be centered around a specific theme to enable choosing relevant participants.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3. Each participant should bring a short presentation on the choosen theme. The presentation must be about an actual personal experience.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4. After each presentation plenty of time for discussions is planned since discussions are the center of gaining insights in experience exchanges.  

&nbsp;**2. Should-haves**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1. Any START2 event should have lot of time to mingle. If you bring a lot of people enthusiastic around the same subject or topic together and give them time they'll happily enter nerd-mode.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2. The group size should never be larger than 10 people since bigger groups get problems with participants not participating.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3. START2 event time should be enough for everyone to hold their presentation and everyone to have a lengthy in-depth discussion about the experience presented.  

&nbsp;**3. Could-haves**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1. Any presentation discussion is more meaningful discussing problem solving. Hence, presentations could prefferably be centered around perceived challenges in the topic to be truly valuable.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2. Discussions could be timeboxed to a set time.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3. If some people stay silent/inactive in discussions due to other people being more extrovert or louder, a Internet-forum like comment system of diffently coloured postit notes or similar could be used. Each participands has a set of these and if any of these cards are held up by a participant, the moderator make sure all people get their things said. The colour codes may be:    
* _Green_ for new thread
* _Yellow_ for comment on current topic
* _Blue_ for reply to previous comment
